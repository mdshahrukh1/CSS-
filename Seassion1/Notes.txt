CSS: Cascading Style Sheet

Styling Language using that we can style our HTML pages and we can make the look & feel of our HTML page.

we can work with CSS in 3 ways

1. Internal CSS:
write the CSS inside HTML page
include using <style> tag
we can include it anywhere in HTML page like head tag
body tag

suggested location is add it in <head>tag

2. External CSS:

create a seperate file with the extention .css name can be anything (ex. mystyle.css)
include the css file to any of your HTML page
for include use <link> tag

<link> tag attributes
href= name of the file which you want to link
rel= "stylesheet" its a mandatory attribute so if you not include this CSS won't work.

<link href="mystyle.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>

type attribute is not mandatory in CSS3 version

3. Inline CSS:
apply unique CSS to a perticular tag than go for inline CSS.

you can apply it to any tag using style attribute and give the values in combination of key vallue pair.

Inline CSS is having a highest priority
